<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Jes, and I'm a 31 year old guy based out of Connecticut. 
  I'm married to my wife Brit, and have 2 amazing cats - Kylo and Korra!</p>

<p>In my professional career, I've held various roles in the tech industry. I started
  my professional career at Apple, where I held roles at the Genius Bar and in Sales.
  In February 2020, I started full-time at Indeed. The first two years I worked on the
  Client Success team, where my Sales' partners and I managed a book of business together.
  In January of 2022, I moved to a new role in the Business Operations and Support Solutions
  organization as a Support Analyst. Being in the tech industry has taught me so much
  about all levels of tech, but the most important thing I've learned about myself is I
  have a deep passion for helping people. More specifically, I love to help people solve problems
  that are complex. I love the process of troubleshooting, analyzing data, and delivering solutions.
  All while learning something along the way!</p>

<p>In my personal life, I have a ton of hobbies. I'm a musician, an avid gamer, a Twitch
  Streamer, and a sports watcher. Oh, and I'm a huge Pokémon fan! In the last few years,
  I've taken up learning the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Every Saturday I attend my
  local Pokémon League and for a few hours of playing, trading, and chatting all things Pokémon!
  It's one of the things I look forward to most after a long week at work, and I'm lucky
  enough that I can enjoy it with my wife, who is also a huge Pokémon fan.
