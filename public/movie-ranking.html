<h1>The Best Movies According to Jes </h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Hands down my favorite movie of all time. Amazing story, amazing soundrack. Nothing compares.</p>
<h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
<p>John Hughes directed some great movies, but this is probably his best. Hits you right in the feels. Also probably one of the best movies of the 80s.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>I can't really narrow it down to just one Star Wars movie, but I suppose my favorite would have to be Revenge of the Sith. Entire series is incredible!</p>
